# Cryptoparties

## What is a cryptoparty

There are many ways to ensure privacy and security without third parties being able to access your data.  
However, figuring out what is the best way and which method is solid is not easy.  
Therefore hackers gather at a socalled cryptoparty where they share their thoughts and tips about securing data and mainaining anonimity.  
Kernelspace also has cryptoparties every now and then but this document contains some information as well about how you can secure your data and digital identity.  


## Passwords
Every website needs passwords but what can you do to prevent hackers from obtaining your password?  
The answer is not as easy as you expect.  
A strong password may be secure today but tomorrow it may be leaked because a service you use was hacked and they did not encrypt your password in their database.  
However strong passwords do contribute to make it harder for people using brute-force attacks to access your account.  
The one problem you probably already have experienced with strong passwords is that they are hard to remember.  
There are two solutions to that and they are both great, you can decide which one is more appealing to you.  

### Password Managers
A password manager is a basically a safe with a lock where you store all your passwords so that you can remember them and make them as strong as you want.  
The problem is that most password managers are not open-source and you do not want to end up storing your passwords on anyones servers in plain text.  
Therefore there are some key-points that help you choose the right password manager.  
They are:

- Is the password manager open-source?  
- Is the sourcecode still update regularly?  
- Does the password manager not use any servers?  
- Does the password manager encrypt data using a strong encryption algorithm and cipher?  

If the answer to all the questions above is yes you can safely use the password manager, otherwise you might ask yourself how safe the password manager can be.  
If you want to make sure you are completely safe it is best to print out a recovery key for the password database and store it somewhere safe.  
With some password managers you can also choose to authenticate with both a password and a private key and choose to store the private key on a USB drive.  
That way you would always need the physical USB drive and to know your master password to access your passwords.  

The password manager that KernelSpace recommends is KeePass.
