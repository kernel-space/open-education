# Capture The Flag

## What is Capture The Flag
A Capture The Flag is a game where hackers try to solve challenges that require skills on a variety of subjects. 
The subjects range from Computer Forensics and Cryptography to Website hacking and low-level binary exploitation.  
The most common CTF game is jeopardy CTF where players compete against eachother in a race to find secret codes in the challenges that represent the flag.  
The player gets points in return for the correct flag and because others play as well it is important to solve the challenges as fast as possible because the points awarded decrease when others already solved the challenges before.  
The winner of the CTF is the player or team with the most points.  
CTF competitions are known to be a valuable asset on a resume when applying for jobs in the Information Security branche, but nevertheless playing challenges are fun too.  
Whenever a competitions ends it is recommended to write a paper about how the challenge was solved.
